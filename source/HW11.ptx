<exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group of order <m>100=2^2\times 5^2</m>. Let <m>H</m> be a Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>. Prove that <m>H</m> is normal. 
        </p>
        </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
            Use the Sylow theorems. Explain how they are applied. 
        </p>
    </hint>

<exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>p,q</m> be two primes such that <m>p>q</m> and <m>q</m> does not divide <m>p-1</m>. If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>pq</m>, prove <m>G\cong C_{pq}</m>. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
        This should be similar to what we did for groups of order <m>15</m>   
        </p>
        </hint>

<exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
         Prove that a group of order <m>56</m> is not simple. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
    Use the same ideas as in the beginning of the proof of Theorem 7.8.1.
        </p>
    </hint>
</exercise>

<exercise>
    <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime number dividing the order of <m>G</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group if and only if the order of every element of <m>G</m> is a power of <m>p</m>. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
    One direction is Lagrange. The other one should involve a Sylow theorem. Also, feel free to use the fact that every positive integer factors as a product of primes. 
        </p>
