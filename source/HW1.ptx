    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
        [Chapter 1, starting p.31]: 1.7*, 5.1, 5.4
        </p>
      </statement>
       <solution>
        <p>
          For problem 1.7: I expect to see an induction proof, with all details.  Note that the convention is that the missing entries in the matrix are zeros.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          [Chapter 2, starting p.69]:  2.3(ab), 2.4(abcde)*, 4.7*
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
           For problem 2.4: Make sure to fully explain in each case why <m>H</m> is a subgroup (prove it!) or why <m>H</m> is not a subgroup (i.e. indicate which one of the laws in the definition of a subgroup does not hold and explain why.)
        </p>
      </solution>
      <solution>
        <p>
      For problem 4.7: The last thing you are asked to prove in this exercise is 
      that (assuming the given hypotheses), the set <m>H=\{1,x,y,xy\}</m> has
      cardinality <m>4</m>.   This is not completely obvious. You need to argue that the elements <m>1,x,y,xy</m> are distinct. For example, why can't we have <m>x=xy</m>?
        </p>
      </solution>
    
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <p>
    Let <m>H </m> be a subgroup of a group <m>G </m>.  Let <m>g\in G</m>, and let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be positive
      integers.  Show that if <m>g^m\in H</m> and <m>g^n\in H</m>, then 
      <m>g^d\in H</m>, where <m>d=\gcd(m,n)</m> is the greatest common divisor
      of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
