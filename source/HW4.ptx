      <statement>
        <p>
        [Chapter 2, starting p.69]: 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9 
        </p>

       <solution>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For Problem 11.3: Since any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic with <m>\mathbb Z</m> 
            (with addition), it is enough to show that
             <m>\mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z\not\cong \mathbb Z</m>. Assume that  an isomorphism <m>\varphi\colon \mathbb Z\to \mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z</m>
              exists. Set <m>\varphi(1)=(a,b)</m>. Try to reach a contradiction, by identifying conditions
               that need to be satisfied by <m>a,b</m>. Keep in mind that the operation is addition
                if you work with <m>\mathbb Z</m>, and thus <m>\phi(n)=(na,nb)</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
           
          For Problem 11.4: To prove that <m>G</m> is a direct product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>,
           use the Product Proposition 2.11.4: make sure to check the three conditions that
            are needed to conclude that the mapping <m>f</m> defined there  is an isomorphism.
              If you want to prove that <m>G</m> is NOT a direct product, please note that the 
              Product proposition cannot be used, because it will only show that the multiplication
               map <m>f</m> is not an isomorphism, leaving open the possibility that maybe some other function could be an isomorphism. 
              Instead, you can try to 
              argue that one of the
              groups has some property (e.g. abelian, cyclic, etc.) while the other one does not.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For Problem 11.6:  If <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> denote the two subgroups, 
            then use the product proposition to show that <m>HK\cong H\times K</m>. 
            Then argue that <m>H\times K</m> has an element of order <m>15</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </solution>

    <exercise>
    <p> [Problem A] Let <m>G</m> be a group. We define a relation on <m>G</m> by: 
<me>
a\sim b \iff \mbox{ There exists } g\in G  \mbox{ such that } b=g^{-1}ag 
</me>
Prove this is an equivalence relation.
