               If on page 98 of your book the Exercises start with ``Section 1 Fields", then do problem:  4.1

  <statement>
    <p> [Problem A] Let <m>\mathcal P_3(\mathbb R)</m> denote the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 3 
      with coefficients in <m>\mathbb R</m>. Consider the function 
<me>
T\colon \mathcal P_3(\mathbb R)\to \mathcal P_3(\mathbb R)
</me>
described as follows: 

If <m>p</m> is a polynomial of <m>\mathcal P_3</m>, then <m>T(p)</m> is equal to the polynomial  <m>2p'(x)+p''(x)+5x^2p(0)</m>
 where <m>p', p''</m> denote  the first, respectively second, derivative of <m>p</m>. 
<ol>
<li>
  <p>
    Prove that <m>T</m> is a linear transformation.
  </p>
</li> 
<li>
  <p>
    Write the matrix of <m>T</m> with respect to the basis <m>(1,x,x^2,x^3)</m> on <m>\mathcal P_3(\mathbb R)</m>.

 <exercise>
  <p>
Recall that we defined <m>O_n</m> to be the group of <m>n\times n</m> orthogonal matrices (with coefficients in <m>\mathbb R </m>), with respect to muliplication. (It is a subroup of <m>GL_n</m>). Now let <m>\widetilde O_n</m> denote the set of all orthogonal operators <m>T\colon \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n</m>. 
<ol>
<li>
  <p>
   Prove that <m>\widetilde O_n</m> is a group with respect to composition of functions. (Show it  is a  subgroup of the permutation group of <m>\mathbb R^n</m> consisting of all bijective functions <m>\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n</m>.) 
  </p>
</li> 
<li>
 Prove the isomorphism:  <m>O_n\cong \widetilde O_n</m> (If you are wondering what the isomorphism should be, ask yourself: how do you associate a matrix to a linear operator?)
</li>
</ol>
