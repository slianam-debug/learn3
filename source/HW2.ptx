      <statement>
        <p>
        [Chapter 2, starting p.69]: 4.2*,  4.6*,  4.9, 5.1,  5.3
        </p>
      </statement>
       <solution>
        <p>
          For problem 4.2: You will need to use some knowledge about roots of unity that is taught in
an undergraduate Complex Analysis class or perhaps some engineering classes. If you never
took such a class, you can search online for relevant information on roots of unity, you could
talk to me about it, or you could get help from your classmates who know this stuff.
        </p>
      </solution>

        <solution>
          <p>
          For problem 4.6: If <m>G=\langle x \rangle </m> is a cyclic group of order <m> n</m>, then an element <m>x^k</m> generates <m>G</m> if and only if <m>x^k</m> has order <m>n</m>. Use the third bullet of Proposition 2.4.3 to describe when this happens. 
          </p>
        </solution>
  

    </exercise>

    <exercise>
    <p> [Problem A] Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group; say <m>G = \langle g\rangle </m>. Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Show that either <m>H =\{1\}</m>
or <m>H = \langle g^d\rangle </m>, where <m>d</m> is the least positive integer such that <m>g^d\in H</m>. (This shows that every
subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.)
    </p>
    </exercise>

    <hint>
      <p>
        You can either try to mimic the proof of Theorem 2.3.3, or perhaps you can
find a way to use Theorem 2.3.3, together with a modified version of part (a) of Proposition
2.4.2.
      </p>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        [Problem B] Let <m>Q_8</m> denote the quaternion group described on page 47
  of the text: <m>Q_8=\{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}</m>.   I suggest using equations (2.4.6) to do computations instead of
  the matrix representations given in the definition.
      </p>
  <ol>
   <li> <p> List all cyclic subgroups of <m>Q_8</m> (and list the elements of each subgroup).  How many distinct cyclic subgroups are there? </p></li>
  <li> Determine the center of <m>Q_8</m></li>
  </ol>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      [Problem C] Prove the statement of the last (3rd) bullet of Proposition 2.4.3 (on page 47).
