     <exercise>
        <p>
        [Chapter 7]: 2.2, 2.3, 2.9abc, 2.13, 3.1, 3.2
        </p> 
        <hint>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
           For 2.2:  Find first the order of <m>Z(x)</m>. Then use the fact that <m>\langle x\rangle \subseteq Z(x)</m>.  
        </p>
    </li>
<li>
    <p>
       For 2.3: Assume that the center <m>Z</m> is not trivial. First, prove that <m>|Z|=3</m>, using the fact that <m>Z\subseteq Z(x)</m> for any <m>x</m>.  What is the class equation of <m>G</m> in this case? 
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
      For 2.13: Since <m>N</m> is normal, <m>N</m> is a union of conjugacy classes of <m>G</m>. To show that <m>N</m> is contained in the center, you need to show that each of these conjugacy classes has order equal to <m>1</m>  
    </p>

</ul>

    <p> 
       [Problem A]  Let <m>T</m> be the group of the 12 rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
               <m>T</m> acts on the set of 4 vertices of the tetrahedron.  Is this action
       faithful?   
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Define an <term>OEP (opposite edge pair)</term> of the tetrahedron as 
       follows:  Two edges form an OEP if they do not share a vertex.  
       The tetrahedron has 6 edges, which are partitioned into 3 OEPs.
       
       <m>T</m> acts faithfully on the set of 6 edges.  However, 
       show that the action of <m>T</m>
       on the set of OEPs is not faithful.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              By making use of part (b) and the permutation representation of the action, show that <m>T</m> has a
       normal subgroup other
       than <m>\{1\}</m> and <m>T</m>. In other words, show <m>T</m> is not
       a simple group.   
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
             How many elements of order 3 are in <m>T</m>? How many elements of order 2? How many elements of order 4? How many elements of order 6?    
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                 Find the class equation of <m>T</m>. (Note that the elements of order <m>3</m> are not all conjugate to each other; explain why.)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              Use the class equation to prove that <m>T</m> does not have a subgroup of order <m>6</m>.  
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

          [Problem B]  Let <m>G</m> be a group of order 150.  Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> 
  of order 25.  (The first Sylow theorem says that such an <m>H</m> must exist.)   Consider the action of <m>G</m> on <m>G/H</m>  by left multiplication: <m>g * aH=gaH</m>.
  Use the permutation representation of the action to show that <m>G</m> is 
  not simple. 
        </p>
    </statement>

        <p>
          [Problem C]  Let <m>G</m> be a simple group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> with <m>[G:H]=n>1</m>. Prove that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the permutation group <m>S_n</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
        <p>
            Consider the action of <m>G</m> on its cosets and the associated permutation representation. Show that the action is faithful, so the representation is injective.

        <p>
          [Problem D] Let <m>G</m> be a simple group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> such that <m>[G:H]=n>1</m>. In Problem C, you proved that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_n</m>. If <m>n>2</m>, prove that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>A_n</m>. 
        </p>

    <hint>
        <p>
            Look at the last part of the proof showing that the  icosahedral group is isomorphic to <m>A_5</m>.
