            Note that, if <m> S</m> is not normal, you do not need to do anything else other than explain why <m> S</m> is not normal. 

If <m> S</m> is normal: The problem asks you to identify the quotient group <m> G/S</m>. 
What does ``identify" mean? You need to establish an isomorphism with a familiar group using FIT. 
 You will have to guess the group and the homomorphism! Once you guess it, make sure to check that 
 it is indeed a homomorphism. To argue that <m> S</m> is normal, you may simply argue that <m> S</m> is the kernel.

        [Chapter 3, starting p.98]: In the past there has been some discrepancy in numbering between different versions of the book. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
               If on page 98 of your book the Exercises start with ``Section 1 Fields", then do problems:  1.2, 1.4, 1.8*, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
               If on page 98 of your book the Exercises start with ``Section 2  Fields", then do:  2.2, 2.4, 2.8*, 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
<hint>
  <p>
  For 1.8 (or 2.8): (a) Use the fact that <m> \mathbb F_p^\times</m> is a group with <m> p-1</m> elements, 
with respect to multiplication, and use a corollary to Lagrange. 
(b) Use the fact that <m> \mathbb F_p^\times</m> is cyclic. Do NOT use any solutions found in other books or on the internet!! 
Most of the solutions out there rely on different methods, that do not relate to the intended purpose of the problem.

    <exercise>
    <p> [Problem A] 
      We proved in class that <m> \mathbb R/2\pi \mathbb Z\cong  \mathcal U</m> , where <m> \mathcal U\subseteq \mathbb C^{\times}</m> 
denotes the unit circle. (This is done using the exponential function <m> \theta\mapsto e^{i\theta}</m> and FIT.) 
Modify this proof to show that  <m> \mathbb R/\mathbb Z\cong  \mathcal U</m> . 
    </p>
    <solution>
      <p>
    <m>\mathbb R</m> and <m>\mathbb Z</m> are considered as groups with addition

  <statement>
    <p>
    [Problem B]
    Consider the multiplicative group <m> G=\mathbb F^{\times}</m> of nonzero elements in a field <m> \mathbb F</m> with <m> n</m> elements. 
    </p>
    <ol>
<li>
  <p>
    Prove that the set <m> H=\{x^2\mid x\in G\}</m> is a subgroup of <m> G</m> . 
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
 Determine the index <m> [G\colon H]</m> . (The fact that <m> \mathbb F</m> is a field is important here. 
 Make sure to explain where it is used.)
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
   Assume <m> -1\notin H</m> . Prove that for each <m> x\in G</m> either <m> x\in H</m> or <m> -x\in H</m> .  Make sure to explain why the hypothesis <m> -1\notin H</m> is relevant. 
</p>
</li>
  </ol>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For (a) I recommend that you construct a homomorphism <m> \varphi</m> such that <m> H=\text{Im}(\varphi)</m> . 
        Then you can use the known fact that the image of a homomorphism is a subgroup. 
        However, make sure to prove <m> \varphi</m> is a homomorphism.  For (b), you need to know <m> |H|</m> .  
        Think about using  FIT. If you can use FIT to show that <m> G/N\cong H</m> for some <m> N</m> that you will have to figure out, 
        then you have <m> |H|=|G/N|=|G|/|N|</m> . For (c), it may be useful to think about the cosets of <m> H</m> .
