<p> Exam 1 covers the following sections from the book: 
</p>
  <ul> 
  <li>

</li>
  </ul>


  <p> Here are some skills that are needed towards problem solving. You need to be able to: 
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Work with permutations, use cycle notation, compute signature of a permutation, find the matrix associated to a permutation. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Give the definition of a: group/subgroup, homomorphism, and use it to prove various properties. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that a given set is a normal subgroup (using either the definition, or cosets, or writing it as a kernel). Also, be able to explain why a given subgroup is not be normal.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that two given groups are isomorphic by constructing an isomorphism (or other arguments, such as: they are both cyclic and have the same number of elements).

      </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I may ask you to write some proofs done in class (about two). I am indicating below a list of proofs that you should be able to reproduce, mainly because I consider the ideas and the skills developed in these proofs to be important. I am also taking the opportunity to highlight below some other advice for your review.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Chapter 1</alert>:  You will not be asked to prove any theorem from this chapter. Review basic properties of matrices, such as <m>\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)</m>, etc. 
      Know what a permutation is and understand the notation. Know how to associate a permutation matrix to a permutation. Know the definition of signature and how to  compute it (either as a determinant, or by counting transpositions.) Know how to write a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. Know how to write a permutation as a product of transpositions. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Chapter 2</alert>: Here is a list of theorems from this Chapter that you may be asked to prove: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
           Theorem 2.3.3 and Propositions 2.3.5. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proposition 2.4.2 and Proposition 2.4.3 (the proof of the last bullet was assigned as hw.) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that the kernel and the image of a homomorphism are subgroups, and the kernel is also normal
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Corollary 2.5.9 (without using Proposition 2.5.8, see class notes)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lemma 2.8.7, the counting formula, Lagrange's Theorem and the corollaries 2.8.10 and 2.8.11.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proposition 2.10.4 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proposition 2.11.4 (a), (b), (c) only
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove: if <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>, then <m>C_m\times C_n\cong C_{mn}</m>. (The proof we did established first a formula for the order of an element in a product group as being the lcm of the orders of the components; be able to justify this formula.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
           The First Isomorphism Theorem 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <p>
  Many of these results are rather important, and it is recommended that you know very well  their statements, so that you can apply them correctly  in various problems. Make sure that you know what needs to be verified in order to apply the Product Proposition or FIT. Also, the last bullet of Proposition 2.4.3 can be rather useful, so make sure to memorize the formula. (Unless asked to prove it, you can use it where appropriate, as you did in the homework)   
  </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Chapters 3 and 4</alert>: The results and definitions of this chapter are mostly ``background". Be able to use them. You do not need to worry about what was not discussed in class. 
I may ask you to prove 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           Prove: <m>\mathbb Z_n</m> is a field if and only if <m>n</m> is prime. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

        </p>
      </li>
