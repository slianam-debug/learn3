        [Chapter 6, starting p.188]: 4.1, 4.3, 5.5, 5.6, 7.1

    <p>For 4.3(b): While we denote by <m>x</m> the smallest non-identity rotation in a dihedral group, please note that this rotation in <m>D_5</m> is not the same as the one in <m>D_{10}</m>. I recommend using <m>x^*</m> for the rotation in <m>D_5</m> and <m>x</m> for the one in <m>D_{10}</m>.  Do not call them both <m>x</m> when you need to make computations that involve both!
However ... What is the relationship between <m>x^*</m> and <m>x</m>? This relationship would be useful in computations.  
    </p>

    <p>
For 4.3(b): One way to proceed is to use the first isomorphism theorem.  You need to define an onto homomorphism <m>f\colon D_{10}\to D_5</m> with Ker<m>f=H</m>. However, when defining the map <m>f</m>, make sure it is well defined, i.e.: If <m>x^iy^j=x^ay^b</m> (this does not necessarily imply <m>i=a</m> and <m>j=b</m>), why can you conclude that <m>f(x^iy^j)=f(x^ay^b)</m>? 
 Also, make sure to check it is a homomorphism.

    <p>
 For 4.3(c) you can use the Product Proposition. Make sure to verify the hypotheses are satisfied.
