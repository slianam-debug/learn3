        [Chapter 6, starting p.188]: 8.2, 9.1, 9.2*, 11.3
        </p> 
        <solution>
    <p>
For 9.2: There are 3 sets, <m>V</m>, <m>E</m>, <m>F</m> and 3 subgroups,<m> G_v</m>, <m> G_e</m>, <m>G_f</m> . There are 9 possible
choices for a set and a subgroup. Thus a complete answer to this problem includes 9 different
formulas, for each of the 9 choices.

       [Problem A] Let <m>G=D_4=\langle x,y\rangle</m>.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Consider the action of <m>G</m> on the vertices labelled 1,2,3,4 of a square centered at the origin, so that vertices 1 and 3 are on the <m>x</m>-axis. 
                Describe the function <m>m_g</m> for: 
            </p>
                <ol>
                 <li>   
                    <m> g=x</m>;

                <li><m> g=xy</m>
                </li> 
            </ol>
              <p>  In each case, write <m>m_g</m> as a cycle or as a product of cycles.

        <li>
            <p>
                Consider the subgroup <m>H=\langle xy\rangle</m> of <m>G</m>. Identify all the distinct left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> and consider the action of <m>G</m>
                 on these cosets. Describe the function <m>m_y</m>; Labelling the cosets as <m>C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4</m> write <m>m_y</m> as a cycle or a product of cycles (as done on page 179 of the book, in a similar situation.)

          [Problem C] The icosahedral group <m>I </m> is the group of <m>60 </m> rotational symmetries of a dodecahedron. 
A diagonal of the dodecahedron is a segment joining opposite vertices. There are <m>10 </m> such diagonals. How many rotations of <m>I </m> are in the stabilizer of a diagonal? (You do not need to describe them, 
just figure out their number.)  Justify your answer using group actions and the counting formula.
